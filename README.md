# Bands In Town

I used React with hooks and an API in built in C# for this app. 

This app is a clone of one of my favorite apps, and the goal was to recreate the design and understand the functionality of [Bands In Town](bandsintown.com).

Data may take up to 30 seconds to load due to the backend being hosted on heroku for free.
